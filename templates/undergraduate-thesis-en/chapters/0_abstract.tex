\begin{abstract}
  Conventional  product  development  employs  a  design-build-test  philosophy.
  The sequentially  executed  development  process  often  results  in  prolonged
  lead  times  and elevated product costs. The proposed e-Design paradigm employs
  IT-enabled technology for product design, including virtual prototyping (VP) to
  support a cross-functional team in analyzing  product  performance,  reliability,
  and  manufacturing costs  early  in  product development, and in making quantitative
  trade-offs for design decision making. Physical prototypes  of  the  product  design
  are  then  produced  using  the  rapid  prototyping  (RP) technique  and  computer
  numerical  control  (CNC)  to  support  design  verification  and functional prototyping, respectively.
