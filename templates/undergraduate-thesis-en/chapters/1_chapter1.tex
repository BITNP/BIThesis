\chapter{Introduction}

Conventional product development is a design-build-test process.
Product performance and reliability assessments depend heavily on physical tests,
which involve fabricating functional prototypes of the product and usually lengthy and expensive physical tests. 
Fabricating prototypes usually involves manufacturing process planning and fixtures and tooling 
for a very small amount of pro-duction. 
The process can be expensive and lengthy, 
especially when a design change is requested to correct problems found in physical tests.

In conventional product development, design and manufacturing tend to be disjointed. 
Often, manufacturability of a product is not considered in design. 
Manufacturing issues usually appear when the design is finalized and tests are completed. 
Design defects related to manufacturing in process planning or production 
are usually found too late to be corrected. Consequently, more manufacturing 
procedures are necessary for production, resulting in elevated product cost\cite{cite1}.
With this highly structured and sequential process, the product development cycle tends
to be extended, cost is elevated, and product quality is often compromised to 
avoid further delay. Costs and the number of engineering change requests (ECRs) 
throughout the product development cycle are often proportional according to the pattern 
shown in Figure \ref{fig:a}. 

It is reported that only 8\% of the total product budget is spent for design; however, in 

the early stage, designdetermines 80\% of the lifetime cost of the product (Anderson 1990). 
Realistically, today’s industries will not survive worldwide competition unless they introduce 
new products of better quality, at lower cost, and with shorter lead times. Many approaches 
and concepts have been proposed over the years, all with a common goalto shorten 
the product development cycle, improve product quality, and reduce product cost\cite{cite2}.


\section{Background}

A number of proposed approaches are along the lines of virtual prototyping,  which 
is  a  simulation-based  method  that  helps  engineers 
understand product behavior and make design decisions in a virtual environment. 
The virtual environment is a computational framework in which the geometric and 
physical properties of products are accurately simulated and represented. A number
of successful virtual prototypes have  been  reported, such as  Boeing’s 777 jetliner,  
General Motors’ locomotive engine, Chrysler’s automotive interior design, 
and the Stockholm Metro’s Car 2000[3]. In addition to virtual prototyping, 
the concurrent engineering (CE) concept and methodology have been studied 
and developed with emphasis on subjects such as product life cycledesign, 
design for X-abilities (DFX), integrated product and process development (IPPD), and Six Sigma.
