  \section{Design Structure Matrix Example}
  One of the most useful applications of the design structure matrix (DSM) method is to represent well-established, but complex, engineering design processes. This rich process modeling approach facilitates:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item  Understanding of the existing development process.• Communication of the process to the people involved.
    \item Process improvement.
    \item Visualization of progress during the project. 
  \end{itemize}

Exhibit 18-14 shows a DSM model of a critical portion of the development process at a major automobile manufacturer.
