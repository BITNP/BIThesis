\begin{acknowledgements}
acknowledgements  This book contains material developed for use 
in the interdisciplinary courses on product development that we teach. 
Participants in these courses include graduate students in engineering, 
industrial design students, and MBA students. While we 
aimed the book at interdisciplinary graduate-level audiences such 
as this, many faculty teaching graduate and undergraduate courses 
in engineering design have also found the material useful. Product 
Design and Development is also for practicing professionals. Indeed, 
we could not avoid writing  for  a  professional  audience,  
because  most  of  our  students  are  themselvesprofessionals who have worked 
either in product development or in closely related functions.

This book blends the perspectives of marketing, design, and manufacturing into 
a single approach to product development. As a result, we provide students 
of all kinds with an appreciation for the realities of industrial practice 
and for the complex and essential roles played by the various members of
product development teams. For industrial practitioners, in  particular,  
we  provide  a  set  of  product  development  methods  that  can  be  
put  into immediate practice on development projects.
